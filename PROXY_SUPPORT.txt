to use a proxy for ts3 connections modify the constructor of the "teamspeak-query" module 
(some path like this: \node_modules\alfred-teamspeak\node_modules\teamspeak-query)

Under this line:

		let sock = this.sock = new net.Socket(options || { });
		
Append:

		/*
		** PROXY SOCKET FOR TS3 CONNECTIONS
		*/

		sock = require('proxysocket').create('serveraddress', 9050, sock);

		/*
		** END PROXY
		*/
		
and replace serveraddress with your proxy address and 9050 with your proxy port.

This is not offically supported and 100% tested, be aware of that.
