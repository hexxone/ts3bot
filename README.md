# How do I ..?

If you want to understand and improve or extend the bot I recommend first reading the config comments.

Next you could take a look at the 'src/commands/aaa_sample.js' file which should explain how commands work.

Going on, the code is mostly commented but you'll have to work yourself through it.

I won't be accepting any issues regarding setup or installation at this point.
